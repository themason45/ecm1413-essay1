    \section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}  % Get 300 words here

    In the book Minority Report, by Philip K Dick, the city police department uses a group of psychics to read
    the minds of the population.
    This allows the police to predict where, and when a crime will be committed by someone, which hence leads to a vast
    reduction in crime for the city, as the police could arrive before the crime, instead of after.
    Of course this raises some ethical issues, as well as some political issues, which will be covered below.
    \\
    While we don't currently have such psychics, we have an awful lot of data, and a vast amount of processing power, so
    what's to say we can't use that data, and AI, to do the jobs of the psychics.
    In this essay we will explore the viability of this, as well as the problems that could arise.

    \section{The problem}\label{sec:the-problem}  % Get 200 words here

    According to the ONS, the levels of crime have been increasing over the past 5 years ~\cite{ons-crime}, which can be
    put down to many reasons, such as a general increase in population.
    We have also seen a continuous decrease in the number of police officers, up until 2019 ~\cite{ho-pw}.
    This would very likely contribute to the increase in crime too, so clearly more has to be done to stop it.

    \section{The solution}\label{sec:the-solution}  % Get 300 words here

    One method to fix this could be to predict crime before it happens.
    While we don't have the Precogs from Minority Report, we do have very powerful artificial intelligence, which is
    already on its way to predicting some crimes.
    \\

    Take Fraud for instance, there are more and more ways to commit fraud, but it is also detectable, and preventable
    given the correct resources.
    If we collected all the financial data, and purchasing history of those who have been proven guilty for
    committing a certain fraud, such as Credit Card fraud, we could then monitor everyone's shopping trends and spending
    habits and compare them to the historical data.
    If this data starts to line up, then we could make the suggestion that said person is about to commit such fraud.
    \\

    Another crime that could be predicted is violent crime.
    While this is more difficult, as it requires monitoring physical environments, it is doable, especially with
    increased monitoring of the population.
    Almost everyone carries a smartphone with them, which can track location, and record sound, we also have extensive
    CCTV systems in built up places, both of these could be used to predict future crimes.
    This would be done by spotting behavioural changes in people, and comparing it to the behavioural changes in
    convicted criminals before they committed their respective crime.
    \\

    All of this analysis would require a huge amount of data, and processing power, so one method to gain this power
    is to use the personal devices of the people themselves to process the data.
    Many phones now have the power to run complex machine learning algorithms on board, and so, if each person's phone
    monitored them and their activities, it could predict the crime, and report it, before it even happened.
    This would be an already available resource to take the place of the Precogs in Minority Report, which don't yet
    exist.
