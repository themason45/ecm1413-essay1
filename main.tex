    \section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}  % Get 300 words here

    In the book Minority Report, by Philip K Dick, the city police department uses a group of psychics, known as
    "Precogs"\cite{mr-book}, to read
    the minds of the population.
    This allows the police to predict where, and when a crime will be committed by someone, which hence leads to a vast
    reduction in crime for the city, as the police could arrive before the crime, instead of after.
    Of course this raises some ethical issues, as well as some political issues.
    It also has some limitations, that could be put down to the available data, as well as how that data is used,
    such as human biases in the data (which is always a factor in these things).
    \\

    While we don't currently have such psychics, we have an awful lot of data, and a vast amount of processing power, so
    what's to say we can't use that data, and AI, to do the jobs of the psychics.
    In this essay we will explore the viability of this, as well as the problems that could arise, as well as make a
    decision as to whether, in 2020, with the technology we have, if its possible, and if it is, how would it
    work?


    \section{The problem}\label{sec:the-problem}  % Get 200 words here

    According to the ONS, the levels of crime have been increasing over the past 5 years ~\cite{ons-crime}, which can be
    put down to many reasons, such as a general increase in population, or the aftermath from the 2008 financial crisis,
    as some people who lost their jobs needed to find other ways to get by.
    We have also seen a continuous decrease in the number of police officers, up until 2019 ~\cite{ho-pw}.
    This would very likely contribute to the increase in crime too, so clearly more has to be done to stop it.
