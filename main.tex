    \section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}  % Get 300 words here

    In the book Minority Report, by Philip K Dick, the city police department uses a group of psychics to read
    the minds of the population.
    This allows the police to predict where, and when a crime will be committed by someone, which hence leads to a vast
    reduction in crime for the city, as the police could arrive before the crime, instead of after.
    Of course this raises some ethical issues, as well as some political issues, which will be covered below.
    \\
    While we don't currently have such psychics, we have an awful lot of data, and a vast amount of processing power, so
    what's to say we can't use that data, and AI, to do the jobs of the psychics.
    In this essay we will explore the viability of this, as well as the problems that could arise.

    \section{The problem}\label{sec:the-problem}  % Get 200 words here

    According to the ONS, the levels of crime have been increasing over the past 5 years ~\cite{ons-crime}, which can be
    put down to many reasons, such as a general increase in population.
    We have also seen a continuous decrease in the number of police officers, up until 2019 ~\cite{ho-pw}.
    This would very likely contribute to the increase in crime too, so clearly more has to be done to stop it.
