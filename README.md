The final output for this essay can be found in main.pdf

I ran:
` texcount -inc main.tex`
to get a word count, which came out as __2956__

To compile your own pdf, then compile main.tex as you normally would.

I used IntelliJ IDEA with a LaTeX plugin to write this, it used the
`pdfLaTeX` compiler.

I also used Git as a VCS, just in case I made a catastrophic mistake, so 
ignore any Git files. 

The `sections/` directory contains all of the subsections, just copy and paste them
into the main.tex if the compiler doesn't like it.
